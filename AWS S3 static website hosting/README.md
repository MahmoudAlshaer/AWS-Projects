# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3.

##  Project Overview
I used AWS S3’s **Static Website Hosting** feature to deploy a simple static site. The setup involved:

-Enabling static website hosting on an S3 bucket
Uploading "index.html" 

The site was accessible through the S3 generated website endpoint. After completing the project and documentation, the bucket was deleted.
